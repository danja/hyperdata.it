Claude told me:

A good place to put utility bash scripts on Ubuntu so they'll be on the PATH is in the `/usr/local/bin` directory. This location has several advantages:

1. It's already in the default PATH for most Ubuntu systems.
2. It's a standard location for locally installed executables that are not managed by the package manager.
3. It's accessible system-wide, so all users can use the scripts.

Here's how you can add your scripts:

1. Create your script file, for example `myscript.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x myscript.sh`
3. Move it to `/usr/local/bin`: `sudo mv myscript.sh /usr/local/bin/`

After this, you should be able to run `myscript.sh` from any directory without specifying the full path.

Alternatively, if you want the scripts to be available only for your user:

1. Create a `bin` directory in your home folder if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p ~/bin`
2. Add this line to your `.bashrc` file: `export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"`
3. Reload your `.bashrc`: `source ~/.bashrc`
4. Place your scripts in `~/bin`

This method keeps your scripts in your home directory and doesn't require sudo privileges.

Would you like me to elaborate on either of these methods?
